                            <p>When the original Microsoft Flight simulator was released almost 40 years ago, it was very much for enthusiasts only. Early home computers could barely cope with drawing cockpit instrument panels, let alone scenery – so what
                                you saw as you fought with the controls was a lot of dials and numbers, usually followed by an on-screen message politely informing you that you had crashed during take-off. This is not the experience you will have with
                                Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Developed by French studio Asobo using accurate geographic data culled from Bing Maps, a global cloud computing network, and real-time weather information, this is as much a visual spectacle
                                as it is a simulator. And you will want to see as much as you can, because at 10,000 feet, the world looks spectacular (especially on the Ultra graphical settings, where it’s almost photorealistic). From craggy snow-topped
                                mountain ranges to swooping desert valleys to bustling cities, the landscape is alive with detail.</p>
                            <p>Without a moment’s airborne experience, you can access the world map on the introduction screen, pick a position and be dropped into a plane flying far above it. With all the many helpful assist options switched on, you can
                                pilot your craft via joypad alone, your only concerns being altitude and air speed. Beneath you, a re-creation of the entire planet rolls by, so large that it would take 14 years of continuous play to see it all. One day,
                                you may catch early morning sun beams rising along the Alps like searchlights, on another, you’ll see New York transform into a constellation of pin-prick stars as dusk drops and office lights take over; every flight, a
                                kind of holiday.</p>
                            <p>And although you may start out crazily barrel-rolling a tiny Savage Cub propeller plane over Seattle, you will progress to piloting a Boeing 747-8, cruising at 35,000 feet, conversing with air traffic control, keeping a close
                                eye on the beautifully replicated control panels, checking for warning lights. As fans of driving games such as Euro Truck Simulator have discovered, there is a sort of zen in simulated long-haul travel, a joy in mastering
                                your role as driver or pilot so that it feels like you’re doing almost nothing – especially when you can pick out real-life scenic details en route. There are moments when the simulation falters. I’ve encountered areas
                                of scenery where trees give way to acres of flat, low-resolution textures, which look ugly and out of place; and although around 400 world cities have been accurately replicated using photogrammetry, others have been constructed
                                using Bing Maps and AI, so that they resemble Lego-like model villages. Disappointingly, London is one of these, and its landmarks are blockily represented as a result. No doubt Asobo will be adding further to its list
                                of fully replicated cities; it is also allowing third-party modelling and simulation specialists to create and distribute their own city models using an in-game marketplace, so users will be able to populate their worlds
                                with favourite locations (at extra cost, of course). But still, Flight Simulator is a true marvel and an astonishing use of Microsoft’s technological resources.</p>
